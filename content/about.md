Hey there, I'm Jonah, a data nerd and machine learning enthusiast currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at ClassPass. With a Bachelor's degree from Claremont McKenna College and a Master's degree in Data Science and Engineering from UC San Diego, I bring a diverse range of skills and expertise to the table.

My main focus is on leveraging data-driven solutions to tackle complex problems in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and wellness. From developing and implementing machine learning models to deploying them into production-level systems, I'm passionate about building solutions that work. And when it comes to coding, I'm all about keeping it clean, simple, and elegant.

Outside of work, you'll probably find me buried in the latest AI research or tinkering with new technologies to see what they can do. But I'm not just a data nerd - I also love hitting the gym and pushing my limits as an amateur powerlifter.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project. Let's build something awesome together!
